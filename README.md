## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**mekkyb-cmyk/mekkyb-cmyk** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Hivexa (tester, not coder)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in HTML/CSS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing at the moment.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing at the moment.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Contact info is unavailable.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: mekkyb, mekky.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've coded in Python and HTML before but with some low knowledge counts.
